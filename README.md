# Assertions-Based Verification Exercises

Welcome to the **Assertions-Based Verification Exercises** repository. This project aims to support engineers, students, and verification practitioners in strengthening their understanding of **SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA)** through clear explanations, structured examples, and practical exercises.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository has been created to provide:

* A formal yet accessible introduction to **assertion-based verification (ABV)**.
* Well‑organized **SystemVerilog testbench examples** that highlight correct usage of assertions.
* A growing collection of exercises designed to reinforce key concepts.
* A collaborative environment where users can learn, experiment, and contribute.

The content is intended for individuals seeking to develop a solid foundation in SVA, as well as for those looking to enhance existing verification skills.

## Repository Structure

```
/intro/           → Introductory theory and fundamental examples
/exercises/       → Practice problems and guided tasks
/solutions/       → Suggested solutions and reference implementations
/testbenches/     → Complete assertion‑based testbench environments
/resources/       → Supplemental reading material and references
```

## Learning Objectives

By working through the material in this repository, you will learn to:

* Write and apply **immediate** and **concurrent** assertions.
* Detect functional and protocol violations using SVA.
* Develop structured and reusable **assertion‑based verification components**.
* Integrate assertions effectively into simulation workflows.

##  How to Get Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   ```
2. Begin with the **intro** directory to review foundational concepts.
3. Attempt the exercises located in the **exercises** folder.
4. Run the examples on your preferred simulator (e.g., QuestaSim, VCS, Xcelium).
5. Compare your work with the reference material in **solutions**.

## Contributing

Contributions are highly encouraged.

You may contribute by:
