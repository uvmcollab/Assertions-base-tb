* FSM Verification Assertion Based

** Descrition

A sequential finite state machine (FSM) that responds to a binary input din and generates an output dout, with three defined states: idle, s0, and s1. The behavior depends on din and the current state, with synchronous transition logic and combinational logic to determine the next state and output, see figure 1.
